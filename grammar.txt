In Chutespeak/Treespeak, there are a lot of words that can be simply joined with other words. Quick-talk, Quick-fly, Deep-think, Deep-speak, etc. are words that might or might not have been mentioned in any storyline sources but they are in fact Chutespeak/Treespeak words. Many words like those mentioned are just emphasized by prefixes such as quick-, bad-, slow-, etc. There are also suffixes like -bones. So things like "a fast battle" could be translated into words such as Quick-battle. However, not all words can be combined. Chutespeak rarely joins more than two words or words of more than two syllables.

In addition to vocabulary, Chutespeak also has its own syntax. This unique method of forming sentences is found mainly in its Treespeak incarnation in Le-Koro. This original usage avoids using articles and state of being verbs and often replaces prepositional phrases with single words. For example, "Feared you were Rahi but no Rama plays Flute like that, so downtree we come and greet!" Or, "Traveler beware- darktime come! Matau stolen, Lewa gone! Le-Matoran prepare for battleflight!" More recent speakers of Treespeak like Toa Nuva Lewa have had this toned down to make them more comprehensible.
